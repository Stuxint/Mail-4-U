Hi! Hearing how people constantly struggled w/ the tremendous load of emails they had 2 reply to, I set out to solve that. So, I built Mail 4 U, an app which replies your emails. 
Sorry if it sucks, I will try to fix. If u have any suggestions, do say so. Ty and GB ğŸ˜„ğŸ˜„ğŸ˜„!


P.S: When running app, try not copy anything, as it might cause an error. The app copies the contents of the email to figure out how to respond, so copying something else, may
cause it to reply to an email in a wrong manner. Sorry about that, will try and look for a solution to it. Thx and GB ğŸ˜„ğŸ˜„ğŸ˜„!
